![Alt text](Keras_HED/Screen Shot 2017-09-04 at 11.06.13 AM.png?raw=true "Optional Title")


Hey guys:

  I implement the Holistically-Nested Edge Detection in Keras.
  
  The code was heavily copied from keras and two other implementations in tensorflow and tensorpack.
  
  This is work in progress. Any suggestion is welcome!
